# Java Problem Set 0

## Setting up & orientation

Fork [Java Problem Set 0](https://repl.it/@kellylougheed/Java-Problem-Set-0) from repl.it.

**Main.java** will serve as the **runner** for your problem set. After you code your programs in separate files, you can press "run," and Main will execute each one of your programs in a row. The code in Main might look confusing right now, but you don't need to interact with it yet (and we will learn all about it in Unit 2)!

Complete each problem in the appropriately named file (e.g. complete "Problem 0-0: Hello World" in HelloWorld.java).

At the top of each file, there is a place for you to comment on the description of the program, your name, and the date. Please also add comments throughout your program about what your code is doing if it is not self-explanatory.
